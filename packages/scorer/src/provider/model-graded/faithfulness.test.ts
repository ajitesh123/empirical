As software ‚Äúeats the world‚Äù, I believe developers have an opportunity to create immense value‚Äîand empowering them to do more drives me to work everyday. I've been lucky to do this as a day job for many years.\n\nI've built some side-projects too, like Covid Maps (featured on TechCrunch, YourStory and CityNews), Rubberduck, VS Code Chat, and the Startup Green Room podcast.\n\nIf there's a way I can help, feel free to reach out.
